# Data Extraction from Coin Market website using an API

This is a personal project where I extracted data from the Coin Market application to explore, analyse and derive insights from the extracted data.

This project includes:
- Interaction with the CoinMarketCap API to retrieve latest crytocurrency listings, such as prices
- Using the Pandas library function to load and display the data
- Cleaning and displaying the Cryptocurrencies percent change in price over different periods
- Visualization of the percent price change of the cryptocurrency over different times using the Seaborn and matplotlib function
